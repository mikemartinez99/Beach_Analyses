## Abstract

**Introduction**
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. Our recent study in Pirc rats revealed that the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and sodium naproxen exhibited additive tumor protection. While the results from this preclinical study were impressive, showing tumor suppression in excess of 95%, potential mechanisms underlying this tumor protection remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the transcriptomic changes resulting in the tumor suppression afforded by the combination of EPA and naproxen supplementation in the diet.

**Methods**
Six week-old Pirc rats were fed either a control AIN-93G diet, or AIN-93G diet supplemented with 2% EPA combined with 200 ppm naproxen, for a total of 20 weeks. Global transcriptomic analysis was performed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of colon tumors and tumor-adjacent normal tissue from 26-week-old Pirc rats. 100-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq to a depth of 25 million reads per sample. Reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-v0.39, and reads were mapped to the mRatBN7.2.105 rat reference genome using HISAT2. Differentially expressed genes were calculated using DESeq2, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using RStudio.
Results: DESeq2 identified 775 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 2-fold change > 1, FDR < 0.05) between large tumors from AIN-93G fed rats versus suppressed tumors from rats fed the combination of EPA and naproxen (500 up-regulated, 275 down-regulated). GSEA analysis revealed activation of inflammatory pathways including myeloid cell differentiation, cytokine signaling, TNF-alpha pathway, and IL-17 signaling were enriched in untreated, control tumors. In contrast, suppressed tumors from animals supplemented with EPA and naproxen were enriched in pathways including TGF-b signaling, cell fate specification, PPAR signaling, and protein digestion and absorption. Furthermore, suppressed tumors shared significant GSEA pathway overlap with normal tissue, leading us to believe the combination of EPA and naproxen may be preventing tumorigenesis in part by maintaining cells in a differentiated state.

**Conclusions**
Inflammation plays a key role in tumorigenesis and promoting cancer stem cell niches in tumors. According to our analysis, the combination of EPA and naproxen attenuated cancer-associated inflammation and reduced proliferation in part by augmenting iCAF formation. Future studies will utilize single-nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) to determine at a single cell resolution the transcriptomic changes of epithelial and stromal populations within the TME. This work was supported by National Cancer Institute task order 75N91019F00132.
